Charkoal canvases are visual notes inside your IDE. They can be connected with any part of your code and with each other. Built to help you think about code.

## Getting Started

Charkoal Canvas is an infinite canvas where you can create nodes, edges, links to your code and other canvases.

After installing the extension, Charkoal provides you some commands to start with. You can:
- create a new empty canvas with the command ‚Å†‚ÄØCharkoal: New Canvas‚ÄØ‚Å† (Cmd/Ctrl + K,  N)
- select any piece of code or symbol and run ‚Å†‚ÄØCharkoal: Sketch the Symbol/Selection (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K, S) from a context menu - to populate a canvas.

You can save and commit your canvas just like any other file.

### Code Canvas ü§ù

Link any part of your code to your canvas. We support two types of links:
- **Node Links** - you can capture any code symbol or file to your canvas as a special node.
- **Text Links** - you can also reference any code symbol, or file or other canvas in your markdown text using `[[]]` notation. The autocomplete will suggest you options while typing.

Canvases can be saved as files and committed to your repository. Charkoal canvas file format is a superset of a [JSON Canvas Spec](https://jsoncanvas.org/) (Obsidian open source canvas model).
